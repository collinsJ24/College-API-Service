# College-API-Service

This project was created to provide a service to retrieve college course information for any given colleges.
There will be a seperate web scraper, written in Python, to populate the DB with college courses for the relevant college.
The API service will then have a number of endpoints to retrieve a variety of information, the main one being to retrieve all courses a college provides.
